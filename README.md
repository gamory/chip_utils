# Chip Tools

Any random tools that I find useful for working with CPUs/MCUs/other ICs.

## Hex.py
This was originally the small Python script that Ben Eater provides for generating hex files.  I decided though that I felt like making it into a small editor.  This is CLI, so it's no replacement for a "proper" hex editor.
